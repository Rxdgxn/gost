# **GOST** 👻
GOST is a simple tool written in Go to create Github Gists fast, straight from your terminal.
So far there is room for improvements, mainly for better error handling + maybe a few more CLI flags, but I am not planning in turning this into a big project.

Props to this website that made it easy to understand what is actually going on (and for the code): https://www.practical-go-lessons.com/chap-35-build-an-http-client

**Note:** in order for this to work, you need to get a personal access token to use the Github API from the "Developer Settings" section (and select the "Gist" scope)
